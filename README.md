11.7 Extreme programming. Unit tests

Task 1. Configure the test environment JUST, you can clone the repository and develop in it, or create your own.

Task 2. Select any implemented function from the JavaScript simulator, add it to the repository in the "Functions" section; think over test cases (successful/unsuccessful execution of the function); think over corner cases; write unit tests (at least 3).
